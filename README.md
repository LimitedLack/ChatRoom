# Chat Room
A basic C# chat room console application. Extremely rough, but functional.

## Download
Download from the GitHub repository releases [here](https://github.com/LimitedLack/ChatRoom/releases/tag/Releases).

## Info
- Server, client, and reader is included in the same binary.
- WAN and LAN access should work, as long as you forward the proper port for WAN.
- No user authentication is included. Any user can claim to be anyone, the only unchangable value is the client number.
- Bugs and overall optimization issues are almost certain.
