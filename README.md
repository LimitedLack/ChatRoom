A basic C# chat room console application. Extremely rough, but functional.

## Download
Download from the GitHub repository releases [here](https://github.com/LimitedLack/ChatRoom/releases/tag/Releases).
The .NET Core 3.1 Runtime is required to run as a standalone, as no installer is included. A link to download it can be found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.20-windows-x64-installer).

## Info
- Server, client, and reader is included in the same binary.
- WAN and LAN access should work, as long as you forward the proper port for WAN.
- No user authentication is included. Any user can claim to be anyone, the only unchangable value is the client number.
- Bugs and overall optimization issues are almost certain.
